1. Movie Rating Prediction with Python:
Build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on
features like genre, director, and actors. You can use regression
techniques to tackle this problem.
The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model
that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or
critics.
Movie Rating Prediction project enables you to explore data
analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine
learning modeling techniques. It provides insights into the factors
that influence movie ratings and allows you to build a model that
can estimate the ratings of movies accurately

2. IRIS Flower Classification
The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor,
and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their
measurements. Now, imagine that you have the measurements
of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species. Your
objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from
these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into
their respective species.
Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris
flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal
measurements. This dataset is widely used for introductory
classification tasks.

3. Sales Prediction using Python
Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that
customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as
advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and
advertising platform selection.
In businesses that offer products or services, the role of a Data
Scientist is crucial for predicting future sales. They utilize machine
learning techniques in Python to analyze and interpret data, allowing
them to make informed decisions regarding advertising costs. By
leveraging these predictions, businesses can optimize their
advertising strategies and maximize sales potential. Let'
s embark on
the journey of sales prediction using machine learning in Python.
